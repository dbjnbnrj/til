Docker Notes

These are some notes to capture what I learnt about Docker the last week.

Why use Docker?
* Unburdening ourselves from installing and running software w/o worrying about dependencies
and setup.

What is Docker?
Platform around creating and running containers

  Ecosystem (Platform)
  Client      Server
  Machine     Images
  Hub         Compose

Docker CLI calls Docker hub and dwnloads image

Image
(file containing deps + config reqd to run pgm)
-> Container
(pgm which has instance of an image; has mem + io)
